This style is loosely based on the Tomorrow Eighties theme shipped with
Textual as of v5.1.4 under the  MIT license.

BitchX theme by Richard Ward (mh@makintosh.org) and contributors.

Some colors were borrowed from the Tomorrow Eighties and base16 themes
of Chris Kempson, and extensively from BitchX 1.x by Colten Edwards.
BitchX colors were matched via Adobe Photoshop to be accurate.
