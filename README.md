# BitchX Theme for Textual

This is version 1.0 of a theme aimed to bring back the 1990s look of console IRC by mimicking the popular IRC client BitchX by Colten Edwards.

The Future:

Some things still need work, such as the timestamps, a more accurate /whois, ctcp notices, and so forth. This is definitely a work in progress and changes are welcome.
